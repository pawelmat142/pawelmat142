I am a novice JavaScirpt focused developer. <br /> <br />
I studied Electrical Engineering at the Gdańsk University of Technology, where I learned the basics of programming in C. <br />
After graduation, I started working as an assistant designer in the power industry, learning programming after hours. <br /> <br />
For 4 months I was working on websites development, where I got to know HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the basics of PHP. <br />
I am currently looking for my first job as a programmer while working on a portfolio. <br /> <br />

My first project is a simple browser app simulating the Jackpot gambling machine game, where I used technologies such as: vanilla JS, Node.js and MySQL.

Another one is To-Do List with drag and drop sorting option made with Angular, Node.js and MongoDB.
