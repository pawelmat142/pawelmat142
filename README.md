## My projects

My first project is a simple browser app simulating the Jackpot gambling machine game, where I used technologies such as: vanilla JS, Node.js and MySQL.

Another one is To-Do List with drag and drop sorting option made with Angular, Node.js and MongoDB.

The next project is a tool that will automate and support the process of translating HTML templates by translators.
### [HTMLtranslationTool](http://drawit.click:8080/) <br /> <br /> <br />

Now I work on the first mobile app based on technologies like Angular 13 + Ionic 6 + Capacitor + Firebase 11. The motivation for this project is to learn Ionic Framework how to build a mobile app and expand Firebase skills to build a secure app with Firebase.<br /> <br />
