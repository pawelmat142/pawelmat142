I am a novice JavaScirpt focused developer. <br />
I studied Electrical Engineering at the Gdańsk University of Technology, where I learned the basics of programming in C. <br />
After graduation, I started working as designer assistant while learning programming after hours. <br />
For 4 months I was working on writing websites, where I got to know HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the basics of PHP. <br />
I am currently looking for my first job as a programmer while working on a portfolio. <br />
My first project is a simple browser app simulating the Jackpot game, where I used technologies such as: vanilla JS, Node.js and MySQL. <br />
Another project will use technologies such as Angular and TypeScript. <br />
