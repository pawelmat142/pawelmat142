# Hi there! 👋 I'm Paweł

## 👨‍💻 About Me
During my studies in electrical engineering, I discovered that programming feeds my need for creativity and there is nothing more satisfying than solving technical or logical problems. My goal is to master the full technology stack to take part in every stage of application development. I am looking for a project where I can truly spread my wings and make a significant impact on its success.

🌱 Currently working on [📱 StageArt](https://github.com/pawelmat142/StageArt) - documentation and bugfixing
