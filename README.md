I am a novice JavaScirpt focused developer.
I studied Electrical Engineering at the Gdańsk University of Technology, where I learned the basics of programming in C.
After graduation, I started working in the industry while learning programming after hours.
For 4 months I was working on writing websites, where I got to know HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the basics of PHP.
I am currently looking for my first job as a programmer while working on a portfolio.
My first project is a simple browser app simulating the Jackpot game, where I used technologies such as: vanilla JS, Node.js and MySQL.
Another project will use technologies such as Angular and TypeScript.
